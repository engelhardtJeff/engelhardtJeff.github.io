    <p>Final Project</p>
    <p>MCS 210</p>
    <p>Fall 2023</p>
    <p>Presentations will be the last day(s) of class, 11 &amp; 12 December</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>For this project, you will design a web site to inform or persuade a
      viewer on a topic of your choice.&nbsp; The topic you choose must be at
      least tangentially related to this class.</p>
    <p>To be related to the class, it must deal with a social, ethical or moral
      issue and technology.&nbsp; Examples of ideas that I may use if I was
      doing this project:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Technology and our betting culture for sports.&nbsp;
      Are we using technology to target people at risk of chronic gambling
      through sports betting?</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E sports, good or bad?&nbsp; How is the prevalence of
      E sports impacting our youth?&nbsp; Are we encouraging socialization and
      activity or dampening it?</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How can we regulate that which we do not
      understand?&nbsp; What level of technical literacy do our lawmakers
      have?&nbsp; What about the general public?</p>
