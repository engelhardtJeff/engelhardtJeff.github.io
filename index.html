    <p>This is a sample web site that I created using <a href="http://bluegriffon.org/#download">BlueGriffon</a>,
      which appears to be a decent free HTML authoring tool.</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>You are welcome to use whatever web Browser you desire for your
      project.&nbsp; I am not endorsing BlueGriffon, but it appears easy to use
      and free.&nbsp; If you want more features you can pay for the extended
      version.&nbsp; If you would like to pay there are many options that you
      can choose.&nbsp; Please work with the people in your group to decide what
      tools you are going to use for your project.</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>You will be using some we authoring tools to design your web page for
      your final <a href="finalProject/MCS210FinalProject.html">project</a></p>
